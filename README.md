# GamerPointsBot
A simple discord bot that tracks a leaderboard of gamer points for your discord server. Server members can award themselves or others gamer points for winning games but you can award gamer points for anything really, it's all just for fun! Just remember that it has a complex implementation of the honor system embedded into the code, so it will definitely know if you don't deserve your gamer points.
